# HUESCAPE
## Ludum Dare #21: Escape

[Ludum Dare Entry Page](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=3178)

You wake up in a strange place. Smooth, alien surfaces all around you, a voice commands you forward to be tested.
You are a rat in an elaborate maze, and something is watching you, trying to learn something from your futile
instinct to escape.

Huescape is a (very) short first-person puzzle platformer. Use the traditional WASD/mouse controls to move around.
You'll figure out the rest.

Written with Unity 3 using some of the included standard assets (primarily the FPS character controller and the
noise post-processing shader), starting about noon Saturday (EST) and submitted for the Jam Sunday about midnight
(a couple hours after the competition closed).
